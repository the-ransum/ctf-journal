# Capture the Flag Beginners Bible


## Workflow Process

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Identify the target system and its IP address.
   - Determine the operating system and software running on the system.
   - Conduct port scanning to identify open ports and services.
   - Conduct network mapping to determine the network topology.
   - Search for any publicly available information about the target system or organization.
2. **Enumeration**
   - Use tools like Nmap, Dirb, or Nikto to identify hidden files, directories, or vulnerabilities.
   - Gather information about user accounts and passwords.
   - Determine the software versions and configurations of the target system.
   - Identify any weak points or misconfigurations in the system.
3. **Exploitation**
   - Use a pre-existing exploit or develop a custom exploit to gain access to the target system.
   - Test the exploit on a sandbox environment to ensure it works as expected.
   - Use social engineering techniques to trick users into revealing sensitive information or granting access to the system.
4. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Identify the user privileges and permissions on the system.
   - Use privilege escalation techniques to gain higher-level access to the system.
   - Exploit any misconfigured permissions or system weaknesses to escalate privileges.
5. **Maintaining Access**
   - Create a backdoor to maintain access to the system even after logging out.
   - Establish a persistent connection to the system to maintain access.
   - Use rootkits or other stealthy techniques to avoid detection.
6. **Covering Tracks**
   - Delete any logs or evidence of your presence on the system.
   - Cover your tracks by modifying timestamps or other system information.
   - Remove any backdoors or other access points that you have created.
